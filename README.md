# NEStation

[NEStation](https://rodri042.github.io/nestation) is a web NES emulator frontend (based on [jsnes](https://github.com/bfirsh/jsnes)), which supports two players net play through [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org)'s p2p data channels.

# Troubleshooting

## I can't connect to my friend's party!

WebRTC does everything it can to connect you with your partner, but things may fail on rare network configurations. In those cases, a quick workaround could be enabling a [DMZ](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMZ_(computing)>) on one side.

## I have stuttering issues!

Then you may want to increase the **Buffer size**, in **Settings**. Lower values offer less input lag, but they can produce stuttering if network latency is not low enough. Try increasing it until it works well.

## Some games don't work!

Well, not all the **NES mappers** are supported. Feel free to raise an issue at [here](https://github.com/bfirsh/jsnes/issues) with the game you're trying to run.

## There's a crackling sound!

Make sure you have your speakers' default format set as **96000Hz** at most:
